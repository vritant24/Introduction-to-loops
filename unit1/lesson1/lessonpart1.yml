  ## Introduction to Loops


  Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow us to execute a
  block of code multiple times. In Python, there are two main types of loops:
  `for` loops and `while` loops. This lesson will introduce you to these loops
  and how to use them effectively.


  ### For Loops


  A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or
  string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. Here's a
  basic example:


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```


  In this example, the loop will print each fruit in the list.


  ### While Loops


  A `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified
  condition is true. Here's an example:


  ```python

  count = 0

  while count < 5:
      print("Count is:", count)
      count += 1
  ```


  This loop will print the value of `count` from 0 to 4.


  ### Practice Exercise


  Try writing a `for` loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10. Then, write a
  `while` loop that does the same. Consider what happens if you change the
  condition in the `while` loop to `count <= 10`.


  ### Summary


  Loops are powerful tools that help automate repetitive tasks. Understanding
  how to use `for` and `while` loops will greatly enhance your ability to write
  efficient code. In the next lesson, we will explore more advanced loop
  techniques and common pitfalls to avoid.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: For loop
            explanation: A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence.

          - id: "2"
            value: While loop
            explanation: A while loop continues as long as a condition is true, not
              specifically for iterating over sequences.
          - id: "3"
            value: Do-while loop
            explanation: Python does not have a do-while loop.
